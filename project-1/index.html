                  <h2>How Changing your Perspective Changes Everything</h2>
                  <p>Written by <a href="https://medium.com/@JohnShufeldt/how-changing-your-perspective-changes-everything-809b4bfd4568">John Shufeldt</a></p>

                    Life is about perspective. If ranked, this is the most important of all the lessons I’ve learned. Simply changing your perspective changes everything.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Changing your perspective changes your attitude toward whatever life can throw at you. When all else fails to fix the problem, change your perspective.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In the grand scheme of things, we’re only among the living for a short time. Why do things that don’t bring you joy or aren’t fun? I’m continually amazed by people who hate their jobs, their lives, their significant others, their bodies, etc., but don’t make any effort to change their circumstances.
                  </p>

                  <p><i>“There are things I can’t force. I must adjust. There are times when the greatest change needed is a change of my viewpoint.” - Denis Diderot</i></p>

                  <p>If they’re unwilling to take the necessary steps, they should at least think about altering their perspective, so that whatever’s making them so miserable is seen with a fresh set of eyes.</p>

                  <p>From my perspective, I like to say I’ve never worked a day in my life. If you figure out a way to enjoy everything you do, then nothing feels like work. Winston Churchill said it this way: “Human beings are of two classes: those whose work is work and whose pleasure is pleasure, and those whose work and pleasure are one.”</p>
