<h5>We all feel emotions. Emotions are at our very core, universally experienced in all human cultures. At age 16, I studied art therapy to understand my fluctuating emotions living alone in the United States. In Art as Therapy, Alain de Botton says, “… from time to time, we encounter works of art that seem to latch on to something we have felt but never recognized clearly before. … a fugitive and elusive part of our own thinking, our own experience, is taken up, edited and returned to us better than it was before, so that we feel, at last, that we know ourselves more clearly.”<br>
    <br>
    Art, in this case visuals, has this ability to help us understand ourselves, and then to communicate who we are to others. We’re trying to let others know about our characters in a way that words might not permit. In a similar sense, graphic design possesses the ability to effectively convey abstractions, serving as a vehicle for storytelling and shaping perspectives.
    I find myself confronted with an introspective journey, reckoning with my own essence once more. I am embracing my vulnerability as a human being and graphic designer. I am here at the rock bottom. Maybe I can start defining my voice from the process. By embracing failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, focusing on my strengths rather than comparing myself to others, and finding joy in the creative process, I can embrace fragilities. Maybe the aesthetic might derive from the imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete:

    “In a world where perfectionism, pleasing, and proving are used as armor to protect our egos and our feelings, it takes a lot of courage to show up and be all in when we can’t control the outcome. It also takes discipline and self-awareness to understand what to share and with whom. Vulnerability is not oversharing, it’s sharing with people who have earned the right to hear our stories and our experiences.” 
    <br><br><br>

    I delve into the exploration of a designer’s vulnerability and emotions, embracing and celebrating the overwhelming power of feelings and meaning. Through my work, I harness the emotive power of graphic design to create meaningful connections, amplifying the parameters of communication. In my graduate school experience, I found new ways of working and myself in 
    a series of graphic design experiments.
    <br><br>
    I want to create a space where designers feel safe to be open and share experiences they’ve been through. I want to show our love for sharing, discussing, and then building a community in new ways. To do that, we have to start with being open to our soft spots a.k.a. vulnerability. I have been talking with my friends, and considering whether vulnerability is something we should actively seek out and if it contributes to our growth as individuals and as a collective. Through these conversations, I have gained a deeper understanding of each person’s perspective and experiences. Getting to know them on a personal level helps me feel a stronger connection with them, as I realize that we’re all navigating similar challenges and experiences together.
    As I prepare to graduate, in a world where you often have to “fake it till you make it,” everyone seems to be projecting confidence and competence, but I am consciously choosing a different path. I present myself as genuine and candid, embracing my true self rather than adopting a facade. I want to be real, not pretend to be someone I am not. The more I open up, the more liberated I feel. I understand that merely opening up about issues that haunt me won’t make my insecurities vanish instantly, but perhaps my embrace of them will gradually diminish their power over me.
    <br><br>
    By being authentically myself in this “fake it till you make it” environment, I want to forge a direct connection with you. I hope you can relate to this journey, finding a shared moment where we can share a laugh. Together, let’s acknowledge the shared experience of maneuvering through the challenges of projecting confidence in a world that often demands us to have everything figured out. It’s a reminder that in our quest for authenticity, amid the pressure to “fake it,” you are not alone­ — I am right there with you.
