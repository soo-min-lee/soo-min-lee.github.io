		<h2>Episode 8<br>
			Apr 2, 2024<br>
			Team Thursday<br>
			Rotterdam, Netherlands
		</h2>

		<h6>Soo Min Lee 00:00</h6>
		<p>Hi Simone! Thank you for joining! I'm such a fan of your work!
			Team Thursday actively searches for ways to transform patterns in everyday life into design. How do you
			initiate your process? When you
			begin creating a pattern, do you start with the color, pattern, or both simultaneously?
		</p>

		<h6>Team Thursday 00:00</h6>
		<p>When we create patterns, it's usually for a specific purpose. For example, last year we made Jacquard woven
			curtains. For that project, we were provided clear direction that we could work with patterns. It also
			aligned well with the weaving technique, allowing us to explore a lot of possibilities. We're particularly
			drawn to vernacular design and find inspiration just by walking around the streets and observing things.
			Many of the patterns we create are based on something we've encountered or seen. It's satisfying for us to
			translate these findings into a flat design. Personally, I find it compelling to use patterns as a sort of
			structural tool in a book if the content calls for it or if we can extract a pattern from the content
			itself. So, typically, we start by finding something — an image or an idea — that we can translate into a
			pattern. We don't usually have specific ideas about how the pattern should look or what colors to use
			beforehand. Instead, we begin with a conceptual approach, relating to a certain content or idea. That's
			usually how we start our formal research into what effect the pattern will have.</p>

		<h6>Soo Min Lee 00:00</h6>
		<p>I love these books, Does a Face Have a Chronology? and Graphic Design Play Book. What I've noticed is that
			you guys enjoy for transforming existing patterns from city facades or patterned hats into fresh
			interpretations. What are your core interests or primary driving themes?</p>

		<h6>Team Thursday 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			In the case of Does a Face Have a Chronology?, it happened during the Seoul residency. Our initial plan was
			to have no plan and just see what happens. This is something we usually can't do in our graphic design
			practice, where there are always assignments and deadlines. While we try not to be overly results-driven,
			there inevitably needs to be a final result. We saw the residency as an opportunity to take a break from
			that. So, we didn't set specific goals; instead, we started walking around a lot. Coming from the
			Netherlands, a country known for its brick architecture and modernist traditions, we were particularly
			fascinated by the highly ornamented bricks we found in the streets.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also love typography, and the idea of creating a variable typeface out of bricks, like a typographic
			bricklayer, intrigued us. We envisioned the stones having solid states but being counter-variable. This led
			us to rethink movements in a typeface in a different way. So, we took these bricks as a starting point, and
			translating them from photos into vector shapes was the easiest way to begin. From there, we continued
			building. In the book, the black type is essentially a regular typeface, but the colorful pages showcase
			various exercises where we built walls of typography. These became an ever-evolving set of types to us.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this case, our goal was never explicitly to “create a pattern.” Instead, it emerged as a result of our
			research. This approach reflects how we like to consider patterns in relation to the content or project
			we're working on, exploring what they can be. This method of working resonates with us.
		</p>

		<h6>Soo Min Lee 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			As you mentioned, graphic design can often be results-driven or heavily influenced by clients. However, I
			believe there's a way for graphic design to be more freeform, allowing designers to approach it as a form of
			play or self-fulfillment. In this sense, I think the process should be more liberal and experimental. I've
			been educated in Western education systems, having moved to the States from Korea during high school and now
			pursuing graduate studies. Initially, I idolized Dutch design and Western design principles, thinking they
			were the ultimate guide to good design. However, as I progressed through grad school, I began to search for
			my own expression and motives within graphic design. I realized that what I had learned might not
			necessarily be the answer and that I could find more freedom within my thesis research. Color and pattern
			are ways I find joy and express myself, which is why I'm curious about your practice.
		</p>

		<h6>Team Thursday 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			Regarding what you're saying, Loes and I studied in Arnhem, and we are Dutch. So, there are certainly
			differences, but we were also brought up with a hardcore modernist tradition. The work we are creating now
			is quite different from what we did at the academy. After graduating, it took us a long time to break free
			from the constraints of this modernist approach and define our own rules and interests. It was a journey
			that took us many years to accept that we could explore different things and to discover what those things
			were.
		</p>

		<h6>Soo Min Lee 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			Did you discover ways to break those rules, or are you still in the process?
		</p>

		<h6>Team Thursday 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			I hope we're still in the process because I'd like to think that this is an ever-evolving thing. But yeah, I
			feel like we're somewhat in between certain traditions or ways of working, and I'm comfortable with that.
			We're not hyper-ornamental in a classical way, but also not hyper-modernist or hyper-conceptual. We're also
			not extremely autonomous because we still work for commissioners. So, I kind of like this place, and I want
			to find out what else we can do.
		</p>

		<h6>Soo Min Lee 00:00</h6>
		<p>What is the purpose behind hosting workshops and exhibitions in your space? You seasonally host different
			workshops and exhibitions at TTHQ?</p>

		<h6>Team Thursday 00:00</h6>
		<p>The evolution of our studio space was quite organic. It's an old garage that now looks like this, situated in
			the city center of Rotterdam. When we stumbled upon this space, we felt fortunate, as it's becoming
			increasingly difficult to find good studio spaces in Rotterdam. During our residency in Seoul, I collected a
			lot of posters from friends, graphic designers I had met. I was always conscious of not wanting to be
			someone who just visits a city for my own benefit without giving something back. So, the first thing we
			organized was an exhibition of these posters here in the space. We decided to use a curtain to separate the
			space into two areas, which turned out to be quite convenient. The idea just evolved naturally, without much
			planning. It was refreshing to organize an exhibition that didn't feature our own works, which can be more
			challenging. We simply wanted to showcase the posters, and the opening reception was a great success. After
			that, it just became a recurring event. Sometimes friends would ask us if they could exhibit here too.
			However, it's been relatively quiet for about one and a half years now, and we're planning the next one for
			September. It can be a bit challenging to organize because our studio is quite packed, and we have to
			rearrange everything. As a graphic designer, it's still a big question for me: How do we want to proceed in
			the coming years? I want to maintain autonomy but don't necessarily want to become an artist. It's an
			ongoing question for me. Organizing these exhibitions allows us to operate autonomously; we don't rely on
			subsidies or external directives. We simply do it when we feel like it. From an organizational perspective,
			it's liberating, and we also learn a lot from collaborating with other artists and discussing how to set up
			the space. It's almost like an annual studio party, but instead of fancy cocktails, we invite artists and
			interested individuals to view the artwork. These organizational aspects and the interactions with visitors
			are integral to our studio's identity.
		</p>

		<h6>Soo Min Lee 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			As you mentioned, 'autonomous,' I think there's an interesting relationship for graphic designers. We often
			have commission-driven work, but we also engage in self-initiated projects. I've been thinking the
			difference between artists and designers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nowadays, the definitions of fine arts and graphic design seem to be a bit blurred, and there's an overlap
			between the two. I visited Na Kim's studio in Berlin and asked her whether she still sees herself as a
			graphic designer or more as an artist. She mentioned that she's starting to identify herself more as an
			artist within the field of graphic design because graphic design tends to be more commission-driven and
			outcome- driven, whereas art is more about expression and revolves around topics of interest. I'm still
			searching for answers myself.
		</p>

		<h6>Team Thursday 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			I think the word 'autonomous' is something I use to challenge myself in a way because I'm very aware that
			our work as graphic designers is not inherently autonomous. This term is more commonly associated with
			artists. However, I find Na Kim to be a great example, and also, during my time in Seoul, designers like
			Sulki and Min and Moonsick Gang seem to blur the lines between graphic designers and artists. Their work
			feels liberated and free, even though they may still work for commissioners.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm now thinking about how I, as a graphic designer, can become my own commissioner. There are Dutch
			designers who start their own publishing houses, venture into education, or launch their own magazines,
			effectively becoming their own commissioners in a way. I find this aspect really intriguing. Perhaps this
			could be a path towards greater autonomy for me.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, I also find that we, as graphic designers, thrive within certain parameters and deadlines. We enjoy
			having specific settings to work within. This contradicts the idea of autonomy to some extent. So, I'm not
			entirely sure how to reconcile these conflicting desires.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope that in the future, we can move away from the traditional design studio model, where we work
			primarily for external commissioners. I'm searching for something different, but I'm not sure exactly what
			it is yet.
		</p>

		<h6>Soo Min Lee 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			So, you're in the phase of searching?
		</p>

		<h6>Team Thursday 00:00</h6>
		<p>Yes!</p>

		<h6>Soo Min Lee 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			How do you manage and balance life and work? You and Loes are mothers and also graphic designers. Graphic
			designers are generally known to be very hardworking, often pulling all-nighters. Balancing being a mother
			and a graphic designer can be tough.
		</p>

		<h6>Team Thursday 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			Loes is not here now because she is on maternity leave, so I can't speak on behalf of us. Also, I'm not sure
			if I have a super clear one. Of course, being a mother and having my own studio makes life a little more
			complicated. There's a constant push and pull for time — where to spend it, whether on my daughter, the
			studio, or even on myself and my husband. There's also a social life. My daughter is two years old now, and
			because of her, I feel like I can cut out a lot of the unnecessary stuff. I have this feeling that I really
			want to work on meaningful projects because otherwise, I would prefer to spend my time with her. I try as
			hard as possible to focus on projects that I can truly relate to. Before, Loes and I would often pull
			all-nighters and work on weekends, which I also kind of love, although it's not healthy. But we could get
			stuck in certain phases of the design process, perhaps postponing decisions because we had the time to
			explore more. Now, with less time, we find ourselves making decisions more quickly, which can be freeing.
			Sometimes, a project just needs to be completed, and moving on from it allows us to take steps forward in
			other projects. Viewing our work as part of a larger exploration, rather than as individual life-or-death
			projects, has been really helpful. Becoming a mother has helped me let go a bit more, yet it's also made me
			even more determined to lead this life and run my own studio. It's a bit of both. It's brought a certain
			focus that I find really beneficial. Of course, there's also the reality of needing to leave work unfinished
			at times to attend to my daughter's needs. When I'm with her, I try to be fully present and not let work
			thoughts intrude. I prefer to keep work and family life separate to give both my best focus.
		</p>
		<p>
			How is this actually in the US and Korea in terms of expectations when becoming a mother, or related
			matters?
		</p>

		<h6>Soo Min Lee 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			Well, from my perspective as a Korean, the working scene in graphic design in the US is less tense compared
			to Korea, for sure. When I was in an agency in New York, people were pretty understanding when you had to
			pick up your kids during the day, and they were supportive of it. But in Korea, there's still a long way to
			go. I've even been told by my boss in Korea that work-life balance isn't something I should seek at my age
			or level of career. In Korea, there's still a lot of work to be done. There are many challenges that need to
			be addressed, especially for women and graphic designers, to reach the balance. What's the point of just
			working hard and being successful if you can't spend quality time with your family or loved ones?
		</p>

		<h6>Team Thursday 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			Yes, I think so too. I have to say, actually, also for us. Sometimes, there's, like, we try to be as
			understanding as possible, me and Loes between the two of us. But we also know that from the commissioners'
			perspective, there's not always the understanding of not being able to work full time. I work full time now,
			but I have been working four days a week previously. So, one day off was just kind of completely neglected
			by commissioners, you know? And also, both times, because Loes has two daughters, and both times she went
			into maternity leave, she was working on a project and the commissioner just totally neglected that she had
			to go into her maternity leave. Could you learn to push deadlines into that? And I think that's really
			problematic. So I think it's still not like the balance, I think it's still not where it should be. But what
			I know in Korea, there's a lot different, a lot harder to do that.
		</p>

		<h6>Soo Min Lee 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			Right, I hope we finds a middle ground for balance somehow.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you for taking the time to chat with me today! It's been insightful and it's been great getting to
			know you on a personal level as well.
		</p>

		<h6>Team Thursday 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			Of course! It's really nice to meet you. Thank you for the nice questions and the nice talk. It's super nice
			to see that our books also in your hands. Good luck with the coming months. I think taking one step at a
			time is a perfect way to do it.
		</p>

		<h6>Soo Min Lee 00:00</h6>
		<p>
			Thank you! Have a nice rest of the day! ●
