  <p id="about">
    “In a world where perfectionism, pleasing, and proving are used as armor to protect our egos and our feelings, it
    takes a lot of courage to show up and be all in when we can’t control the outcome. It also takes discipline and
    self-awareness to understand what to share and with whom. Vulnerability is not oversharing, it’s sharing with people
    who have earned the right to hear our stories and our experiences.”
    <br><br><br>

    I delve into the exploration of a designer’s vulnerability and emotions, embracing and celebrating the overwhelming
    power of feelings and meaning. Through my work, I harness the emotive power of graphic design to create meaningful
    connections, amplifying the parameters of communication. In my graduate school experience, I found new ways of
    working and myself in
    a series of graphic design experiments.
    <br><br>
    I want to create a space where designers feel safe to be open and share experiences they’ve been through. I want to
    show our love for sharing, discussing, and then building a community in new ways. To do that, we have to start with
    being open to our soft spots a.k.a. vulnerability. I have been talking with my friends, and considering whether
    vulnerability is something we should actively seek out and if it contributes to our growth as individuals and as a
    collective. Through these conversations, I have gained a deeper understanding of each person’s perspective and
    experiences. Getting to know them on a personal level helps me feel a stronger connection with them, as I realize
    that we’re all navigating similar challenges and experiences together.
    As I prepare to graduate, in a world where you often have to “fake it till you make it,” everyone seems to be
    projecting confidence and competence, but I am consciously choosing a different path. I present myself as genuine
    and candid, embracing my true self rather than adopting a facade. I want to be real, not pretend to be someone I am
    not. The more I open up, the more liberated I feel. I understand that merely opening up about issues that haunt me
    won’t make my insecurities vanish instantly, but perhaps my embrace of them will gradually diminish their power over
    me.
    <br><br>
    By being authentically myself in this “fake it till you make it” environment, I want to forge a direct connection
    with you. I hope you can relate to this journey, finding a shared moment where we can share a laugh. Together, let’s
    acknowledge the shared experience of maneuvering through the challenges of projecting confidence in a world that
    often demands us to have everything figured out. It’s a reminder that in our quest for authenticity, amid the
    pressure to “fake it,” you are not alone­ — I am right there with you.
